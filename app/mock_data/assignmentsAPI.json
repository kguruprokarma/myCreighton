Your information is confidential; no names are used and only the instructors assigned to the course have access to this information. </p>\\n<p><strong>Science GPA computation</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Using the Excel spreadsheet tool available in this module, enter grade information on the science courses you have completed. It is best to download the spreadsheet to use; there are two worksheets - one is an example and the other is blank for you to fill in. (In PharmCAS, this includes classes in these subject areas: \\n<ul class=\"box\">\\n<li>Biochemistry</li>\\n<li>Biology</li>\\n<li>Inorganic Chemistry - General Chem</li>\\n<li>Microbiology</li>\\n<li>Organic Chemistry</li>\\n<li>Other Science</li>\\n<li>Physics</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>Enter the letter grade earned, the GPA points for that letter grade (see key), and number of credit hours completed. </li>\\n<li>If you have taken any of these courses away from Creighton, you should still enter them into the spreadsheet with the grade earned at the other institution.  </li>\\n<li>Note that you enter both instances for any courses repeated. PharmCAS includes all grades in GPA computations. </li>\\n<li>As you enter the information, there will be a GPA calculation at the end of the spreadsheet.  Make a note of this for your records and enter it here. </li>\\n<li>Save the spreadsheet to keep track of your ongoing science GPA. </li>\\n<li>PharmCAS also figures a Math GPA, and a Non-Science GPA.  For this assignment we will just compute the Science GPA.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Overall Creighton GPA </strong> </p>\\n<p>You can find your current overall Creighton GPA by logging into the NEST. </p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Click on Student Services.</li>\\n<li>Click on Student Records.</li>\\n<li>Click on Academic Transcript.

Scores of Creighton students yell and cheer for their favorite players. We see Patty getting called onto the field for a beanbag toss during halftime. She laughs as she throws beanbags. Her friends cheer. We see additional images of the soccer team scoring and winning during the closing moments of the game. Then, we see Patty leaving the stadium with her friends Sarah and Justine. They walk to the Slowdown. We see them get their hands stamped at the door. Inside, a DJ plays and young people dance. Patty dances with her friends. We see a progressive series of still images that zoom in on Patty’s watch. Time passes: 11:30, 12:30, 1:45, 2:30a. A progressive series of still shots zoom out. We watch Patty and her friends leave the bar and walk back to campus.

Jim is in bed. We hear the sound of his alarm clock going off. The clock reads: 4:45am. Though it is early in the morning, Jim is smiling. We see images of Jim smiling as he exits his dorm, gets into his car, and goes to rowing practice. He continues to smile even as he is sweating, rowing sprints at practice. He smiles at breakfast when he is sitting near his friends. He continues to smile after breakfast during a 3-hour chemistry lecture. We see him smiling as he naps on one of the couches in Reinert, a chemistry book propped up on his chest. He is smiling when he wakes up to go to BLUJ radio to host his radio show. He is smiling while he eats dinner and when he returns to his room in order to study for three hours before going to bed. We see him before he goes to sleep, smiling in bed.

the energy that is required to break the intermolecular forces comes from the other molecules, resulting in a decrease in temperature.  In Organic Chemistry, you will use a \"rotovap\" - a device that reduces the pressure over a sample in order to remove the solvent.  Most rotovaps have a water bath to keep the temperature constant.  What would happen to the temperature if you were not able to use the water bath (i.e. you had no way of keeping the temp constant)?  Be able to explain your answer.  (Consider the relationship between vapor pressure, external pressure and boiling/evaporation.  Ch. 10.5 of your textbook may be useful.)</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Is the process of evaporation endothermic or exothermic?  How do you know?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Explain why weaker overall intermolecular forces lead to a greater change in temperature than stronger intermolecular forces.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><strong>Material from the<a title=\"Expt 2 (Jul 19) -

In this project, you will write to articulate your own identity by considering your existential purpose. This unit will ask you to answer the question: What are the arguments – broadly conceived – that you’ve encountered in the course of your life that have impeded your progress to realizing your life’s purpose? Why are these arguments persuasive, and in what ways are they erroneous or deceptive? To help us understand the scope of these questions, we will read Man’s Search for Meaning, which was written by a psychiatrist and philosopher named Victor Frankl, who survived the Holocaust to found a new school of psychoanalysis known as logotherapy.</p>\\r\\n<p>We will also study argumentative fallacies in public culture in an attempt to understand the ways that we are influenced by various media. Finally each student will write a 1,750-2,000-word essay that describes one erroneous, wrongheaded, or deceptive public or private argument. In the essay, students will answer three main questions:</p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p>Section #1: What argument has impeded your progress toward realizing your life’s purpose? What is the social context for that argument? In other words, where and how has that argument manifested in your life?</p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p>Section #2: Did/does your understanding of the argument change your opinion about it? Will/has this understanding changed the way you act/plan to act in the future? Why or why not?</p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p>Section #3: What would Victor Frankl say about this argument? What advice would Frankl give based on our reading of Man’s Search for Meaning? Optional: What advice would the creators of the Happy documentary likely provide regarding this argument?</p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>For homework on 3/26, you should write Section #3 of your paper, and you should submit your whole essay (Sections 1-3) here.

You’ve worked with Sam on a student committee, and you’ve enjoyed your interaction with him. One night at a party, Sam and your friend become intoxicated and end up sleeping in the same room at another friend’s apartment. The following week, your friend seems sad and distant. You ask her if she’s feeling Ok, and she replies that “everything’s fine” and changes the topic. But, as days and weeks pass, she seems increasingly withdrawn. Further, she has missed every student committee meeting where Sam would normally be present. And you noticed that when you mentioned your friend’s name to Sam recently, he wouldn’t look you in the eye. You’ve talked to some of your other peers who knew your friend in high school, and it seems that your friend has a history of depression and anxiety. Your friend looks like she’s losing weight, and you’re really concerned about her wellbeing. How should you proceed in this situation?</span></p>","assign_due":"2015-03-04T00:15:00.000Z","assign_title":"Short Response #6: Withdrawn Friend","assigned_date":null,"course_name":"15Sp ENG 150 K: Contemporary Composition:College Composition (Spring 2015)","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"5.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"201510_ENG_150_K","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"discussion_topic","term_name":"Spring 2015"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000005753097","assign_desc":"<p>Instructions:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Using the instructions in your workstation, log onto the Dispensing Audio Folder.

These technical standards articulate the expectations and requisite abilities considered essential for occupational therapy students to become primary providers of occupational therapy services. All students admitted to the Doctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD) Program should be able to demonstrate these abilities at the time of admission and at all times during their matriculation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Observation / Sensory <br></strong>Students must have sufficient visual abilities to be able to observe and interpret patients/clients accurately. They should also possess functional tactile and proprioceptive skills and abilities necessary to perceive and synthesize inputs during patient/client interaction, evaluation, and treatment.</p>\\n<p><strong>Communication <br></strong>Students must demonstrate effective verbal and written communication with patients, family members/caregivers, faculty/staff, fieldwork preceptors, payers, elected officials, members of the healthcare team and others. They must demonstrate appropriate communication with people of different ages and genders, with diverse physical, cognitive and emotional abilities, and from different cultural, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds and lifestyles. Students must demonstrate the ability to use therapeutic communication and a client centered approach. They must display adequate English language skills in written and oral communication.</p>\\n<p><strong>Motor <br></strong>Students must display adequate motor skills to provide safe, efficient, and effective occupational therapy treatment. Examples of motor skills include sitting tolerance, splint or assisted technology fabrication, computer usage, performing transfers and assisting with bed mobility, and providing range of motion and strengthening activities. These motor skills require adequate gross and fine motor function, vestibular function, strength, and functional usage of the sensory system.</p>\\n<p><strong>Intellectual / Conceptual <br></strong>Students must demonstrate problemsolving throughout the didactic and experiential components of the program. This includes the ability to interpret information from multiple sources (written, verbal, environmental, interpersonal, etc.), carry out instructions in a timely manner, and understand and follow policies and procedures. Therefore, the student must be able to read complex material, and write in a way that is accurate, descriptive, free from errors and consistent with guidelines or standards. Further, students must be able to apply critical thinking processes in order to gather information, identify problems and alternative plans of action, and make decisions spontaneously, in \"on the spot\" situations, frequently under pressure from multiple workload, time and variable environmental demands.</p>\\n<p>Behavioral / Social Skills / Professionalism Students must posses sufficient emotional health to fully utilize their intellectual abilities, exercise good judgment, adhere to ethical standards, complete patient care responsibilities promptly, and relate to others with courtesy, compassion, maturity, and respect for their dignity. Because occupational therapy education and practice takes place in a large variety of settings, students must have the ability to participate collaboratively as a (professional) team member, must be able to modify behavior in response to feedback, and display emotional health when faced with changing environments, clinical uncertainties, and stressful workloads that include multiple concurrent demands and short deadlines. This requires the ability of students to be aware of and appropriately react to their own emotional responses. In addition, students must at all times maintain personal appearance and hygiene that is appropriate for professional and classroom settings.</p>\\n<p><strong>Attainment of Technical Standards <br></strong>Inability to comply with these technical standards may result in course failure. Applicants are encouraged to voluntarily discuss their disabilities with the Director of Admissions and the Assistant / Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the School in order to consider and prepare for the accommodations that may be needed. After enrollment, a student with a disability who wishes to request reasonable accommodations may directly contact the Assistant / Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the School or the Creighton University Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. Verification and documentation of the disability by a qualified professional, such as a physician or psychologist, will be needed before reasonable accommodations are made. Accommodations will not be considered reasonable if they affect the substance of the occupational therapy educational program, compromise the School’s educational standards, and/or negatively affect the safety of students and/or other people, including patients, with whom they may come into contact in the course of their studies. If accommodations are provided, this information will be kept in strict confidence.</p>\\n<p>All occupational therapy applicants must review the technical standards described in this document and perform a self-evaluation to determine if they are able to maintain compliance with them. </p>\\n<p><a id=\"\" class=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://spahp.creighton.edu/sites/spahp.creighton.edu/files/Technical%20Standards%20Occupational%20Therapy.pdf\">View the PDF version</a><br> Do not sign and return form as requested.</p>\\n<p><strong><em>Once you have read the material, take the quiz at the bottom of this page.</em></strong></p>","assign_due":null,"assign_title":"Technical Standards for Occupational Therapy","assigned_date":null,"course_name":"Group: eOrientation 2016","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"0.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"PH_CG_eOrientation_2016","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"online_quiz","term_name":"999999"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000004560917","assign_desc":"<p><strong><em>See the following resources for intellectual property, bibliographic, and citation information: </em></strong></p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em><a id=\"\" class=\" instructure_scribd_file instructure_file_link\" title=\"LP_Day Twenty Five.pptx\" href=\"/courses/972311/files/44424037/download?wrap=1\">LP_Day Twenty Five.pptx</a></em></strong></p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>UPDATE: Please submit your whole Wikipedia article (including your bibliography) here either via text entry or as a Word document by 7pm on Thursday, April 30th.</em></strong></p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>UPDATE: </em>For the homework on 4/23: please write an additional 400-500 words on your Wikipedia article.

Based on the film <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, identify three examples where the film uses images that may create inaccurate or harmful beliefs or behaviors in a viewer. Explain why you believe these images may lead to inaccurate or harmful beliefs and why the images were used in the film. Identify two instances where the film uses images that may create accurate or helpful beliefs or behaviors in a viewer. Explain why you believe these images may result in accurate or helpful beliefs and why the images were used in the film. </p>\\r\\n<p>5. Define each of the elements of the Health Belief Model (perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived costs, and perceived efficacy). Using examples from one or more health promotion messages, explain how the message (or messages) uses each of the four Message Components from the Health Belief Model to target a specific belief and change that belief. Identify the intended health behaviors that the message or messages will produce.</p>","assign_due":"2015-12-19T11:59:00.000Z","assign_title":"Exam 2","assigned_date":"2015-12-08T12:00:00.000Z","course_name":"15Fa COM 173 B: Health, Communication, and Media (Fall 2015)","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"100.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"201570_COM_173_B","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"online_upload","term_name":"Fall 2015"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000004402003","assign_desc":"","assign_due":null,"assign_title":"QUIZ 1","assigned_date":null,"course_name":"15Sp ENG 120 J: World Literature I (Spring 2015)","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"100.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"201510_ENG_120_J","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"on_paper","term_name":"Spring 2015"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000005788078","assign_desc":"<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Academic Success Plan</strong></span></p>\\r\\n<p>You have already proven your academic abilities by being accepted into your professional program, but our experience has been that often graduate-level work can provide new challenges to students.

Based on feedback provided by your peers and your instructor, you should make changes to the outline. Also, you should convert the outline from a preparation outline to a presentation outline. This assignment asks you to develop extemporaneous speaking skills, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only use your presentation outline to verbally deliver your speech in Step 3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Practice several times before recording so that you are comfortable speaking from an outline.

As you listen think about how Eloquentia Perfecta calls us to speak and act on issues of social justice in the contemporary world.</span></p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 2: Come up with a topic that is relevant, significant, and substantive. Your topic should be, broadly, related to the overall message you have taken away from your Critical Issues in Human Inquiry (CIHI) class. Work to a<span>pply a lesson of your CIHI class to the contemporary world so that you can speak about a social issue you care about. Answer the question: What issue in the contemporary world has your CIHI class prepared you to speak about? </span>Consider how your topic relates to the Jesuit Charisms and how as a speaker, you can apply the principles of Eloquentia Perfecta through your message. Research your topic and develop some understanding of its role in the larger world. It may be helpful to choose a topic related to your speech in your Critical Issues in Human Inquiry class (note: these are two different assignments and you will need to adapt them to two different purposes). </span></p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 3: Make a video that expresses your topic, connects the topic clearly to Jesuit values, and demonstrates your understanding of Eloquentia Perfecta. The video must have a central thesis, utilize organization of main points, and include at least two published and credible sources (verbal citation required within the speech and APA citation required in video’s Description). The video must be between two and four minutes long. At least two-thirds of the video must have you physically in-frame, delivering your message. </span></p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is a digital assignment, it is still oratory. Cutting and editing techniques are allowed and encouraged as appropriate/useful if you feel comfortable using them. You are encouraged to make smart cinematic choices, from good lighting/audio to meaningful background/ foreground decisions. Think of these as more ‘‘available means of persuasion,’’ and make your decisions thoughtfully. If you choose to ‘‘sample’’ or ‘‘re-mix’’ clips for the purposes of your video, be sure to cite your sources and respect Copyright law. </span></p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may work in groups and may choose the same topic as other students, while you are working on topic generation.

In order to function as a clinical physical therapist, an individual must be able to meet certain physical, emotional, intellectual and communication expectations for performance. Physical therapy education requires the accumulation of scientific knowledge as well as the simultaneous acquisition and demonstration of psychomotor skills and professional attitudes and behaviors. The faculty is committed to an educational environment where students may “identify, define and grow to fulfill the responsibilities of a professional within society”</p>\\n<p><strong>Program Philosophy</strong></p>\\n<p>The purpose of technical standards is to delineate the psychomotor, cognitive and affective skills and abilities deemed essential for matriculation into, continuation in and completion of the educational program. Technical standards are necessary to create specific expectations for student performance in the classroom, laboratory and clinical education environments. Technical standards must be met with or without reasonable accommodations consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>\\n<p><strong>Technical Standards - </strong>Psychomotor Skills/Observation</p>\\n<p>The student must possess sufficient sensory and motor function to independently perform a physical therapy examination and intervention utilizing procedures including observation, palpation, auscultation, percussion, bariatric assessment, manual assistance and manual resistance. In general, this requires functional use of vision, hearing and somatic sensation including the ability to perceive position, pressure, movement, weight and vibration. Examples of specific observation skills include examination of non-verbal patient communication, skin integrity, radiographic findings, graphic representations of data, changes in body position/movement and gauges on equipment. A student must be able to respond to occurrences such as a patient calling from behind a curtain, warning calls from anyone and machine alarms. In the classroom, a student must be able to independently observe and participate in laboratory dissection of cadavers, the microscopic analysis of tissues, and lecture and laboratory demonstrations in all courses.</p>\\n<p>A student must be able to perform motor movements required to provide general and emergency care to all patients. These skills necessitate coordination of gross and fine movement of the trunk and limbs, equilibrium, strength and the integrated use of touch and vision/ hearing. Examples of specific motor abilities include writing or use of a keyboard, performance of gait training using therapeutic aids and orthoses, manual mobilization techniques, non-surgical wound debridement, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and lifting/ moving a patient on a bed/mat or during an assisted transfer between surfaces. A student must be able to possess a level of physical endurance to function under physically challenging workloads or in stressful environments.</p>\\n<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>\\n<p>A student must be able to understand and communicate in English effectively with patients and their families. A student must be able to understand and communicate in both written and spoken forms and demonstrate the ability to use therapeutic communication to attend, clarify, coach, facilitate and touch during the patient-provider encounter.</p>\\n<p><strong>Conceptual/ Integrative Abilities</strong></p>\\n<p>To effectively solve problems, a student must be able to measure, calculate, reason, analyze, integrate and synthesize information in a timely manner. For example, a student must be able to synthesize knowledge and integrate relevant aspects of the patient history and examination findings in order to develop an accurate physical therapy diagnosis and determine the appropriate intervention within reasonable time constraints imposed by the needs of the patient, the facility and the standards of care.</p>\\n<p><strong>Behavior, Social Skills and Professionalism</strong></p>\\n<p>Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, good interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all required personal qualities. A student must possess the emotional health necessary for the full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement (including the maintenance of patient confidentiality), prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to course assignments and the development of mature, sensitive and effective patient relationships. This requires the ability of the student to be aware of and appropriately react to one’s own immediate emotional responses. A student is expected to be able to accept and reflect upon appropriate suggestions and criticisms and, if necessary, respond by modifying personal behaviors. Students should also conduct themselves at all times in a manner consistent with the American Physical Therapy Association Code of Ethics and Guide for Professional Conduct.</p>\\n<p><strong>Attainment of Technical Standards</strong></p>\\n<p>All students should review the Policy on Student Compliance with Technical Standards and sign below with your NetID acknowledging that the policy has been read and the student attests they are in compliance with the policy. If the student believes that he/she has a disability that necessitates accommodation to meet these technical standards, the student must submit documentation of the disability, along with a request for reasonable accommodation, to the Director of Admission and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.</p>\\n<p>The technical standards are integrated into syllabi in all courses across the curriculum. In certain cases, compliance with technical standards is a prerequisite for a course. In some cases, compliance with technical standards must be maintained to successfully complete a course. Students who fail to meet technical standards that are defined as prerequisite course requirements should request a leave of absence from the program. If a student fails to meet technical standards while participating in a course, the student should discuss the situation with the Instructor of Record(s) and their faculty advisor. Students who cannot meet technical standards while participating in a course may request a grade of Incomplete from the Instructor of Record or request a leave of absence from the program. Otherwise, inability to meet technical standards may result in course failure. If a student believes he/she has a disability that necessitates accommodation to meet these technical standards, the student must submit documentation of the disability, along with a request for a reasonable accommodation, to the Director of Admissions and the Assistant/Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.</p>\\n<p><a id=\"\" class=\"instructure_file_link \" title=\"\" href=\"https://spahp.creighton.edu/sites/spahp.creighton.edu/files/Technical%20Standards%20Physical%20Therapy.pdf\">View the PDF version</a></p>\\n<p><strong><em>Once you have read this information, click \"Take Quiz\" at the bottom of this page.</em></strong></p>","assign_due":null,"assign_title":"Technical Standards for Physical Therapy","assigned_date":null,"course_name":"Group: eOrientation 2016","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"0.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"PH_CG_eOrientation_2016","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"online_quiz","term_name":"999999"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000005261102","assign_desc":"<p>1.  All options were true except:  The lymphoid system is very important for the production and distribution of all blood cells.  It is only important for the production and distribution of lymphocytes (not red blood cells or other white blood cells)</p>\\r\\n<p>2.  The thymus does not remain an essential lymphoid organ through life.

what you were planning on studying in college, you’ve replied, “Bio, Pre-Med.” This has become part of your identity, even if you claim that your plans are subject to change. Honestly, you haven’t really considered any other options. Further, you’ve earned A’s and B’s in your science classes, so there’s still a chance that you will be competitive for medical school. Now, in the middle of your sophomore year, you realize you love your medical sociology class. You find yourself looking forward to your readings in sociology, and doing your organic chemistry homework feels like a chore. You convince yourself that this is only because you have not yet entered the upper-level science classes, where the class size will be smaller and there will be more opportunity to interact with your professors. Additionally, every time you’re home for a break, your parents proudly announce to their friends and members of your extended family that you’ve made the Dean’s List as a pre-med student at Creighton. But when fall registration comes around, you’re not entirely confident in what you want to do. Should you continue in your science classes or try sociology? You don’t have many credit hours to spare, so you feel like wasting credit hours really isn’t an option.</span></p>","assign_due":"2015-03-04T00:15:00.000Z","assign_title":"Short Response #5: Pre-Med

Organisms must also perceive biotic factors, such as the presence of mates, competitors, predators, and prey items. Perception of both abiotic and biotic factors may involve sight, sound, touch, taste, chemicals, electrical signals, light or other mechanisms. Similarly, organisms have mechanisms by which they can communicate information to other members of the same species or members of other species. This might include communication with potential mates, competitors, symbiotes, predators, or prey. Communication might be audio, visual, chemical, or through some other means.</p>\\r\\n<p>For your paper, you will research an aspect of perception or communication in an organism or organisms within your assigned taxonomic group. You might want to focus on a particular species or type of organisms, such as mechanisms of perception in sharks or communication with fungal symbiotes in plants. Alternatively, you might want to compare and contrast perception in two different types of organisms within your group, such as communication between mates in two types of spiders or birds. You might also explore a particular kind of perception or communication mechanism, such as vocalization in insects or quorum sensing in bacteria. Remember that this is a biology class, so the majority of your paper should focus on biological concepts.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">General Instructions: <span style=\"color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Please see page 141-145 of your lab manual for all guidelines.</em> </span><br></span></strong></p>\\r\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Your assignment is to write an essay of about 1500 words</strong> (approximately 5 double-spaced pages). <strong>The word count must be included at the end of the paper. </strong>The essay must be submitted in electronic format to the appropriate online folder.  Your TA will provide you with more specifics about the submission process. Your essay is due by 11:59 pm on November 21st.

The other two may be secondary sources (work described by individuals other than the scientists who did the studies), including review articles. Both primary scientific literature and review articles are considered <strong>scholarly, scientific sources</strong> and should make up the bulk of your sources. You should use Internet web sites or clearly non-scientific sources on a limited basis and use extreme care when choosing these sources; the Library BIO 205 course guide provides a list of acceptable internet resources.  Note that printed journal articles that are also accessible on the web count as “scholarly, scientific sources”.  You are encouraged and expected to consider the relevance of additional material encountered since the submission of the bibliography and, thus, your bibliography might not be identical to the bibliography you previously submitted.</li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Failure to cite articles appropriately may be considered plagiarism and result in the appropriate penalties.</span></li>\\r\\n</ul><p> </p>","assign_due":"2014-11-22T11:59:00.000Z","assign_title":"Research Paper","assigned_date":null,"course_name":"14Fa BIO 205 AA: General Biology: Organismal and Population Lab (Fall 2014)","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"50.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"201470_BIO_205_AA","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"online_upload","term_name":"Fall 2014"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000005085223","assign_desc":"<p>Your comments for each speaker should include: 1. strengths and weaknesses of the speaker's physical delivery, 2. strengths and weaknesses of the speaker's verbal delivery, 3. something new or surprising that you learned from the presentation, 4.how the speaker handled the questions from the audience, 5. two comments about things the speaker did well (other than delivery), and 6. two comments making suggestions for improvements the speaker might make in future presentations (other than delivery).</p>","assign_due":"2015-11-12T11:59:00.000Z","assign_title":"Ryan Edmonds 2","assigned_date":"2015-11-02T12:00:00.000Z","course_name":"15Fa COM 173 B: Health, Communication, and Media (Fall 2015)","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"5.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"201570_COM_173_B","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"discussion_topic","term_name":"Fall 2015"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000004914894","assign_desc":"<p> </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the chapter discusses, there are multiple ways to choose and order the main points of a speech.

The annual premium will be applied to the student’s account unless an online waiver is completed (see waiver information below). Detailed information may be obtained by visiting the Student Health Services website (listed above).</p>\\n<p>Health insurance waivers will start being accepted for enrolled students in July. The insurance waiver process can be completed by logging in to your NEST account and clicking on the \"Student Services\" link/tab. The waiver process must be completed each academic year. Please complete the waiver process promptly to avoid an unnecessary insurance premium charge. After September 1, 2016, the University will not be able to remove the charge and you will remain enrolled in the insurance plan until August 2017.</p>\\n<p><em><strong>Once you have read this information , click \"Take Quiz\" at the bottom of this page.</strong></em></p>","assign_due":"2016-06-16T09:59:00.000Z","assign_title":"Health Insurance Requirements and Student Health Overview","assigned_date":"2016-03-01T12:00:00.000Z","course_name":"Group: eOrientation 2016","netid":"4d646ad917","points_possible":"0.0","schedule":null,"sis_source_id":"PH_CG_eOrientation_2016","ssrmeet_bldg_code":null,"submission_types":"online_quiz","term_name":"999999"},{"netid_pk":"4d646ad917","assignment_id":"11170000005791284","assign_desc":"<p>In addition to the commercial background check through Verified Credentials, Inc., students in the Alaska pathway are required to complete a criminal background check through the state of Alaska, as required by health care facilities in Alaska.

Some of the topic areas we covered include using the five Canons of Rhetoric, creating a preparation outline (likely the same outline you will give your CIHI instructor), a presentation outline, using transitions, developing a preview and summary statement, stating your thesis, verbally citing sources, creating a reference page of sources, using energy and enthusiasm, providing meaningful gestures, establishing eye contact with your audience, and using a visual aid that best supplements your presentation. You should consider implementing all of these strategies into your CIHI presentation and any future presentations.  </p>\\n<p><strong>We encourage you to stand up, use note cards, and dress professionally for this practice presentation.  </strong></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h4>As Critical Listener, you complete the following for each member of your discussion group.</h4>\\n<p><strong>48 Hours after a group member has posted a presentation:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Once you receive notice that one of your group members has uploaded a video, you have 48 hours to reply to their video with feedback.</li>\\n<li>Your discussion reply should include <strong>at least two strengths to retain and two areas of improvement.</strong>\\n</li>\\n<li>You must provide feedback to<strong> each member of your group</strong> as they post their practice speech.

This will help you avoid having to look down to the camera.</li>\\n<li>Prepare notecards of your presentation; do not read off of your screen or a manuscript.</li>\\n<li>Speak in a well-lit room.</li>\\n<li>Speak loudly and clearly, practicing projection just as you would in front of an audience.</li>\\n<li>Consider the background of your video; avoid objects, posters, and people that will distract your viewers.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p>Technical Considerations:  </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Record your video at a resolution no higher than 720p.

Long videos of 14 minutes at high resolution have difficulty being uploaded.</li>\\n<li>Recording your video in an MP4 file format helps limit file size and will make uploading videos easier.</li>\\n<li>Some browsers work better than others.

At the time of the experiment, there were 500 million active users on Facebook. Bakshy’s experiment included 253 million of them and more than 75 million shared URLs, meaning that in total, the study observed nearly <em>1.2 billion</em> instances in which someone was or was not presented with a certain link. This scale is unheard of in academic sociological studies, which usually involve hundreds or, at most, thousands of people communicating in ways that are far less trackable.</em></p>\\r\\n<p><em>At the same time, there’s an obvious problem with Bakshy’s study: It could only occur with the express consent of Facebook, and in the end it produced a result that is clearly very positive for the social network. The fact that Facebook’s P.R. team contacted me about the study and allowed me to interview Bakshy suggests the company is very pleased with the result. If Bakshy’s experiment had come to the opposite conclusion—that, say, the News Feed does seem to echo our own ideas—I suspect they wouldn’t be publicizing it at all. (Bakshy told me that he has “a good amount of freedom” at the company to research whatever he wants to look into about the social network, and that no one tells him what to investigate and what to leave alone. The study is being submitted to peer-reviewed academic journals.)</em></p>\\r\\n<p>Then, answer the following question: <em><strong>Has Dr. P adequately triangulated his sources here?

For example, you were asked to \"jot down bullet points\" to speak about. This instruction is responsive to the need to organize a speech or, put another way, to consider the Canon of \"Disposition.\"</p>\\n<p>In your replies to two classmates consider the role the canons played in the creation of your classmates' Student Introduction Video. <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rGs-SoFOWA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">This video demonstrates how to participate in Blueline discussions. </a></p>\\n<p><strong>The following aspects of chapter 1 should be included in your replies to at least two classmates, be sure to answer each part in each reply:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>How did he/she use the canon of invention to help generate his/her introduction?</li>\\n<li>How did the canon of disposition impact the order of his/her speech? </li>\\n<li>What choices did he/she make about style during the video?</li>\\n<li>How would you characterize her/his delivery in the video?</li>\\n<li>Did he/she memorize what he/she was going to say in the video?

This will help you avoid having to look down to the camera.</li>\\n<li>Prepare notecards of your presentation; do not read off of your screen or a manuscript.</li>\\n<li>Speak in a well-lit room.</li>\\n<li>Speak loudly and clearly, practicing projection just as you would in front of an audience.</li>\\n<li>Consider the background of your video; avoid objects, posters, and people that will distract your viewers.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p>Technical Considerations:  </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Record your video at a resolution no higher than 720p. Videos recorded in 1080p will have difficulty being uploaded.</li>\\n<li>Keep the length of your within the assignment expectations.

Creighton University Medical Center School of Pharmacy and Health Professions has an ethical responsibility for the safety of patients for whom the students come into contact. Therefore, patient safety is a major factor in establishing requirements for physical, cognitive, and emotional capabilities of applicants for communicational, motor, intellectual-conceptual (integrative and qualitative), behavioral, and social skills and abilities. The School is committed to enabling students with disabilities by reasonable means of accommodations to complete the course of study leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Some accommodations cannot be made because they are not reasonable. For example, the use of a trained intermediary is not acceptable. The use of a trained intermediary is however, not acceptable in many clinical situations in that it implies that a candidate’s judgment must be mediated by someone else’s power of selection and observation. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Observational.  </strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The candidate must be able to visually observe and interpret presented information.

Examples of such tasks may include the compounding of medicinals, administration of drugs of the provision of basic cardiac life support. Such actions require the coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses. </span></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities. </strong>Problem solving and critical thinking are key skills to proper performance of the responsibilities of a pharmacist.

The ability to participate collaboratively as a professional team member is essential. The pharmacy student must display emotional health in spite of a stressful work, changing environments, and clinical uncertainties. The pharmacy student must be able to modify behavior in response to constructive criticism. He/she must exhibit behavior and intellectual functioning which does not differ from acceptable standards. </span></span></p>\\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Attainment of Technical Standards.  </span></strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Inability to comply with these technical standards may result in course failure.

After enrollment, a student with a disability who wishes to request reasonable accommodations may directly contact the Assistant / Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the School or the Creighton University Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. Verification and documentation of the disability by a qualified professional, such as a physician or psychologist, will be needed before reasonable accommodations are made. Accommodations will not be considered reasonable if they affect the substance of the Doctor of Pharmacy educational program, compromise the School’s educational standards, and/or negatively affect the safety of students and/or other people, including patients, with whom they may come into contact in the course of their studies. If accommodations are provided, this information will be kept in strict confidence. <br></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Students must evaluate themselves for compliance with these technical standards.
